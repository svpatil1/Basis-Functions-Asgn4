###### Goal:

 To consider how we can perform non-linear regression.
 
 ###### Implementation:
 
 The following basis functions has been studied,
 1. Quadratic function
 2. Polynomial function
 3. Radial Basis function
 4. Fourier Basis function
 
 For a given set of data, the fit of following basis functions were experimented.
 
 ###### Obesrvations:
 
 When higher order polynomial is used, it may lead to overfitting. Eventough all the points gets fit to the polynomial function, giving minimal error, if new point is introduced to the system for prediction can give wrong prediction.
 
 Also, if polynomial with small degree is used, can lead to underfitting (i.e very less points get fits to the function). It will increase the error and thus will give wrong predictions.
